## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the travel industry, leading to widespread layoffs and impacting economies, livelihoods, public services, and opportunities globally. Every aspect of the extensive travel value chain has faced significant challenges.

The lockdowns took a considerable mental toll on individuals, resulting in feelings of fear and anxiety that have led to both short- and long-term psychosocial and mental health issues for people of all ages.

In the wake of these challenges, the trend of "revenge travel" has emerged. Eager to escape the confines of their homes after months of stress, remote work, online learning, and limited social interaction, many people are donning masks, getting vaccinated, and rushing to explore the world again.

Post-pandemic travel has sparked a heightened desire to explore like never before, although many travelers still carry concerns and face ongoing restrictions.
